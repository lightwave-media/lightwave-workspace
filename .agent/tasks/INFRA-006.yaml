title: Establish Cost Monitoring & Alerting System
description: |
  Emergency shutdown workflow exists (.github/workflows/emergency-shutdown.yml) indicating
  cost concerns, but there's no proactive cost monitoring:
  - No AWS Cost Explorer alerts configured
  - No budget alerts for unexpected spend
  - No tagging strategy for cost allocation
  - No cost estimation in CI/CD pipeline (see INFRA-002)
  - No monthly cost review process

  This task implements comprehensive cost management to prevent emergency shutdowns.

  IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE - 2025-10-29

  ## What Was Delivered

  ### 1. Cost Reporting Scripts (lightwave-infrastructure-live/scripts/)
  - cost-report-daily.sh: Generates daily cost reports with anomaly detection
  - cost-compare-monthly.sh: Compares current vs last month spending
  - check-idle-resources.sh: Identifies unused resources (EBS, snapshots, IPs, etc.)
  - create-cost-dashboard.sh: Deploys CloudWatch dashboard

  ### 2. Terraform Budget Module (lightwave-infrastructure-catalog/modules/budget/)
  - Reusable module for AWS Budgets with SNS alerting
  - Multi-threshold notifications (70%, 85%, 100%, 110%)
  - Environment-specific filtering via tags
  - CloudWatch alarm integration
  - Full documentation with examples

  ### 3. Terragrunt Budget Configurations
  - Production: $500/month budget with 4 alert thresholds
  - Non-Production: $150/month budget (dev $50 + staging $100)
  - SNS topics for email and Slack integration
  - CloudWatch alarms for critical thresholds

  ### 4. CloudWatch Cost Dashboard
  - Real-time cost monitoring with budget annotations
  - RDS, ECS, ElastiCache utilization metrics
  - S3 storage by tier visualization
  - Data transfer and network metrics
  - JSON template ready for deployment

  ### 5. Documentation
  - Cost Allocation Tags guide with activation instructions
  - Monthly Cost Review template with step-by-step workflow
  - SOP_COST_MANAGEMENT.md (already existed, now fully implemented)

  ### 6. Makefile Integration
  - make cost-report-daily: Run daily cost report
  - make cost-compare-monthly: Monthly comparison
  - make check-idle-resources: Find waste
  - make create-cost-dashboard: Deploy dashboard
  - make deploy-budgets: Deploy all budgets
  - make activate-cost-tags: Activate cost allocation tags
  - make cost-setup: Complete one-command setup

  ## Budget Thresholds Configured

  ### Production ($500/month)
  - 70%: Email to management
  - 85%: Email + SNS to team and management
  - 100%: Critical alert + CloudWatch alarm
  - 110%: Forecasted overage alert

  ### Non-Production ($150/month)
  - 80%: Email alert
  - 100%: Email + SNS alert
  - 150%: Critical alert (emergency shutdown consideration)

  ## Cost Allocation Tags (Required on All Resources)
  - Environment (prod/non-prod/dev/staging)
  - ManagedBy (Terragrunt/Manual)
  - Owner (team name)
  - CostCenter (Engineering)
  - Project (LightWave Media)
  - Service (backend/frontend/shared)
  - Component (database/compute/storage)

  ## Deployment Instructions

  1. Deploy budgets: `make deploy-budgets`
  2. Confirm SNS email subscriptions (check inbox)
  3. Activate cost tags: `make activate-cost-tags` (takes 24hrs)
  4. Create dashboard: `make create-cost-dashboard`
  5. Schedule daily reports: cron daily at 9am
  6. Schedule monthly reviews: first Monday of each month

  ## Cost Optimization Opportunities Documented

  1. RDS Reserved Instances: Save 40% ($120/month for db.t3.medium)
  2. ECS Compute Savings Plans: Save 50% ($75/month on $150 baseline)
  3. S3 Lifecycle Policies: Save 90% by moving old data to Glacier
  4. Idle Resource Cleanup: Variable savings (typically $100+/month)
  5. ElastiCache Reserved Nodes: Save 30-55%
  6. Spot Instances for Dev: Save up to 90% on compute

  ## Related Emergency Controls

  Existing emergency shutdown workflow (.github/workflows/emergency-shutdown.yml)
  now integrated with budget monitoring. Can be triggered manually or
  via SNS when non-prod budget exceeds 150%.

  ## Testing Performed

  - Scripts validated for correct AWS CLI syntax
  - Terraform module validated (not deployed yet - requires AWS credentials)
  - Terragrunt configurations reviewed for correct paths and variables
  - CloudWatch dashboard JSON validated
  - Makefile targets tested for correct paths

  ## Next Steps for Deployment

  1. Deploy budgets to AWS (requires AWS_PROFILE=lightwave-admin-new)
  2. Confirm SNS email subscriptions
  3. Wait 24 hours for cost tag activation
  4. Run first daily cost report
  5. Schedule monthly cost review meeting
