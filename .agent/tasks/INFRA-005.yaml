title: Create Disaster Recovery Testing & Runbook
description: |
  deployment.yaml (line 139-161) mentions backup strategy (daily RDS, 30-day retention,
  point-in-time recovery) but there's NO documented procedure for:
  - How to actually perform a restore from backup
  - RTO/RPO targets and verification
  - Full stack disaster recovery (database + infrastructure + application state)
  - Disaster recovery testing schedule
  - Communication plan during incidents

  This task creates comprehensive DR documentation and establishes regular DR testing.

acceptance_criteria:
  - SOP created with step-by-step RDS restore procedure
  - SOP created with full stack recovery procedure (infrastructure → database → app)
  - RTO/RPO documented for each environment (dev 4hrs, staging 2hrs, prod 30min)
  - Disaster recovery test performed in non-prod and documented
  - Runbook created for common disaster scenarios (data loss, region failure, etc.)
  - Communication templates created (incident notification, status updates)
  - DR testing schedule established (quarterly for prod, bi-annually for non-prod)

risks_if_not_done:
  - Unknown recovery time if disaster occurs
  - Untested backup restoration may fail when needed
  - No clear communication plan during incident
  - Potential data loss beyond acceptable RPO
