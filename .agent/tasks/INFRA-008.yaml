title: Create Infrastructure Testing Framework with Terratest
description: |
  Infrastructure modules in lightwave-infrastructure-catalog have no automated tests:
  - No validation that modules work as expected
  - No regression testing when modules are updated
  - No integration tests for module combinations
  - Module changes risk breaking downstream dependencies

  Gruntwork recommends Terratest for infrastructure testing. This task establishes
  comprehensive testing for all infrastructure modules.

acceptance_criteria:
  - Terratest framework set up in lightwave-infrastructure-catalog
  - Example tests created for 3 core modules (ECS, RDS, Redis)
  - Tests verify resources are created correctly
  - Tests verify resources are destroyed cleanly
  - CI/CD pipeline runs tests on PR
  - Test coverage documented for each module
  - Test writing guide created for future modules

notes: |
  Terratest resources:
  - https://terratest.gruntwork.io/
  - https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest

  Test pattern:
  1. Deploy infrastructure using terraform.Init and terraform.Apply
  2. Validate infrastructure (check outputs, query AWS)
  3. Destroy infrastructure using terraform.Destroy
  4. Validate cleanup (ensure resources deleted)

  Run tests in isolated AWS account to prevent conflicts

implementation_summary: |
  Completed comprehensive infrastructure testing framework with Terratest.

  Files Created:
  1. test/modules/ecs_fargate_service_test.go - Comprehensive ECS Fargate tests
  2. test/modules/postgresql_test.go - Full PostgreSQL RDS testing suite
  3. test/modules/redis_test.go - Complete Redis ElastiCache tests
  4. test/helpers/aws_helpers.go - AWS SDK helper functions
  5. test/helpers/terraform_helpers.go - Terraform testing utilities
  6. test/helpers/retry_helpers.go - Retry and wait helpers
  7. .github/workflows/infrastructure-tests.yml - CI/CD workflow
  8. test/TESTING_GUIDE.md - Comprehensive testing documentation

  Files Modified:
  1. test/Makefile - Added 15+ new test targets
  2. test/go.mod - Added Redis and PostgreSQL driver dependencies

  Test Coverage:
  - ECS Fargate: 5 test scenarios (outputs, service health, ALB, HTTP endpoint, security)
  - PostgreSQL RDS: 6 test scenarios (outputs, status, connectivity, operations, backups)
  - Redis ElastiCache: 6 test scenarios (outputs, status, connectivity, operations, persistence, Celery)

  Features Implemented:
  - Minimal tests (validate without deploy) for fast PR checks
  - Full module tests with deployment and validation
  - Integration tests for multi-service scenarios
  - Test helper library for reusable functionality
  - CI/CD pipeline with cost optimization
  - Comprehensive documentation with examples

  CI/CD Integration:
  - Automatic validation on all PRs (free)
  - Conditional deployment tests via label or main push
  - Parallel execution for faster results
  - Cost tracking and reporting
  - Proper cleanup after tests

  Cost Management:
  - Minimal tests: $0 (no deployment)
  - ECS test: ~$1 (~5 min)
  - PostgreSQL test: ~$2 (~15 min)
  - Redis test: ~$1 (~10 min)
  - Full suite: ~$4 (~30 min parallel)

  Next Steps:
  - Run tests on actual module changes to verify
  - Expand coverage to VPC, Lambda, S3 modules
  - Add performance benchmarking tests
  - Implement cost optimization tests
