    feat: initialize lightwave-workspace multi-repo structure

    - Add workspace-level documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md)
    - Configure .agent/ directory with metadata, tasks, sops, schemas
    - Configure .claude/ directory structure for persistent context
    - Set up .gitignore for multi-repo workspace
    - Establish GitHub Actions workflow directory structure
